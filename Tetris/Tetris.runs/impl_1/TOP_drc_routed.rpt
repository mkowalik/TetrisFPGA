2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer ps2_data_IOBUF_inst/IBUF (in ps2_data_IOBUF_inst macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_VGA/my_draw_background/b_reg[3]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_VGA/my_draw_background/b_reg[3]/L3_2/O, cell my_VGA/my_draw_background/b_reg[3]/L3_2 (in my_VGA/my_draw_background/b_reg[3] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_VGA/my_vga_timing/rgb_out_reg[11]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_VGA/my_vga_timing/g_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell my_VGA/my_vga_timing/g_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
